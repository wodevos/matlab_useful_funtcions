function files=makeAllUnzipped(files)
% this function makes sure all files are unzipped; so it checks if it is
% the case and if it is not, does the unzipping (and returns the same
% filelist , but then with only unzipped files)

% vier situaties: filename ends with .gz or not
% unzipped file exists or not
% (when the filename does not end with .gz, the unzipped file exists
% automatically, so then we don't have to do anything)

    parfor i=1:length(files)
        
        
        
        
    end
end
